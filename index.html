            <p>
                My name is Andrew Moran and I just received my Master's in Computer Science at Northeastern
                University
                with the goal of pursuing opportunities as a technical program manager within the cyber security field
                in
                Seattle, Washington. Prior to enrolling in this program, I spent 7 years as a Cyber Operations Officer
                in
                the Air Force performing both operations and program management and after which I took time to pursue a
                Master's in Project Management and additional graduate coursework and certifications in cyber security.
            </p>
            <p>
                While I have discovered that I have strengths in managing both projects and programs, I felt that
                expanding
                my technical knowledge would allow me to be more effective in those roles. As an IT manager I developed
                firsthand experience at communicating technical concepts to a non-technical audience. In my computer
                science
                studies I have programmed in Java, Python, JavaScript, Dart, and C, and have gained experience in cloud
                computing, database design, security engineering, and both web and mobile application development. I am
                driven by a desire to continually learn and expand my knowledge base and thrive in environments that are
                continually evolving. I am also adept at looking at issues and finding their root cause and coming up
                with
                creative ways of addressing them.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe that my experience managing teams and projects in the Air Force, in conjunction with the
                skills
                and knowledge I have developed in my both my computer science and project management master's programs,
                will
                make me a fit for technical program management and cyber security roles.
